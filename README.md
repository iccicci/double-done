# ABSTRACT

I have always liked __JavaScript__, but when I deeply understood its power, I have fallen in love with it!

One of the greatest aspect of __JavaScript__ is that, thanks to its other strenght points, it helps saving the _most
expensive_ resource of the whole software life cycle: __developers time__.

## Single Done desing pattern

From now on: __SD__

### Hard Doube Done desing pattern

or simply: Double Done design pattern

From now on: __HDD__ or simply: __DD__

### Soft Doube Done desing pattern

From now on: __SDD__
